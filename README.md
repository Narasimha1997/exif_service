# exif_service
A C++ microservice used to extract location and other forensic information from JPEG images.

### How to run 
The application needs to be compiled and linked to generate a binary for target platform. It can be run on host machine as well as in a container.

### Features:
1. Written in C++ with no library dependencies.
2. Simple stateless microservice which can be hosted on cloud or on-premise.
3. JSON logging support with ISO timestamp embedding.
4. Health endpoint to monitor the service's availability.
5. Native tool, which can be used as a CLI command to get JPEG EXIF data without running the server.

#### Run on host machine :
Any x86 Linux host can easily run this binary. Follow the instructions below :
`GNU G++` and `make` are enough to build this on any linux distro. 

1. Generate the binary :
We have provided a makefile to ease build process. 
```
make web
```
This will generate the binary at `build/server`

2. Run the binary :
We can run the binary using following command :
```
$./build/server
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8888

```
By default, the logs will be redirected to `stdout`. Pass the log-file as argument to enable file-logging.
```
./build/server $PATH_TO_LOG_FILE/log.txt
```

This will run the server. 

#### Build a docker image :
To reduce the size of docker image, we have used alpine-linux as base with minimal required dependencies.

1. Build the container image:
Build the image using command below :
```
docker build . -t exif_service
```

2. Spin up the container :
We can use docker run the container, the log directory is expected to be mounted at `/logs`.
```
docker run --rm -ti --net=host -v ${LOG_FILE_PATH}:/logs exif_service
```

### Using the REST Api:
The server provides two rest endpoints :
1. Check health of the service :
This endpoint is just like ping.
```
curl http://localhost:8888/health
```

2. Run exif extraction:
The endpoint `jpeg` takes `multipart/form-data` and produces JSON output.
```
curl -X POST -F 'image=@{IMAGE_ABS_PATH}/image.jpg' -H Content-Type:multipart/form-data" http://localhost:8888/jpeg | json_pp
```

The output is a list of complete image information as per EXIF standard.
